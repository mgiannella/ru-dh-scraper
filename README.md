# RU Dining Hall Scraper
## A tool to scrape the RU dining services website for nutrition info.

### How to install
Clone the repository to your local machine. Will need Python 3 for this code to run properly. 

### Usage
Run the script whenever you would like to scrape the dining services website.  
```
cd ru-dh-scraper // or whatever directory scraper.py is in
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scraper.py
```
It will download all of the foods in neatly organized json files.  (Examples of those files from my testing during Summer 2018 are included in the repository) The script will log by default into a file called log.txt in the ru-dh-scraper folder. 

### Future of this project
* Scheduling of the scraper
* Alternative to JSON for data storage
